Hello. My name is Christian Caspers, I am 29 years old and I am a programmer 
from Germany. I mostly use java and javascript and make a living adding new 
features to a java-based cms-application.

Besides my part-time job, I study at the RheinMain University of Applied 
Sciences in Wiesbaden to earn my M. Sc. in computer science.
